# Midterm Presentations
* Date: Friday, June 21, 2024
* Time: 10am-12pm
* Room: Olin Library 703 (across the hall from the CoLab)

## Preparation 
During the mid-program presentations, each Fellow will informally present on their project intentions during the following three weeks. 

In your presentation, please briefly discuss the following:
* A concise overview of the purpose or research question(s) guiding your project
* The current state of your project data
* Your project goals for the next three weeks
* Anticipated challenges (as well as strategies for navigating those challenges)

You can also ask the group questions if you'd like feedback or ideas. 

**Plan to present for about 7 minutes, then receive feedback or questions for up to 5 minutes.** We'll keep to a strict timeline during this session to make sure everyone has time for questions and feedback!

In order to minimize time between transitions, we ask that you use a slidedeck (e.g., using Google Slides) and post the link to this Github page in the table below, next to your name.
