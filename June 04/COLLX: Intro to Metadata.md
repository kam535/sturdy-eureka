# Introduction to Metadata

## Before the Session 

##### Assignment

Please bring one or two hats to the session today *-- BUT -- conceal it until we have our exercise relating to the hats.* (If you do not own a hat or have access to one you can borrow, simply bringing any accessory that could be worn on your head.)  The hat might have an origin story that you wouldn't mind sharing in class, or can be completely utilitarian.  Increased diversity of headgear will make this exercise the most meaningful, so the more unusual, the better. 

##### Briefly Review or Skim

* *Wikipedia*'s entry on [Musical Instrument Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument_classification)  

* FoodOn: a harmonized food ontology to increase global food traceability, quality control and data integration.
  [Homepage](https://foodon.org/) and [Apple Product Diagram](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41538-018-0032-6/figures/3).

* [Ontology Introduction](https://foodon.org/design/ontology-introduction/) from the FoodOn site.

### Part II: Let's discuss metadata for your projects  

Ideas to keep in mind:  
* Controlled vocab
* Hierarchy
* Flexibility and Extensibility
* Faceting

What might your metadata application profile (MAP) look like?

## After the Session

#### Daily Comment

Please post a reflection on something you learned today or that you would still like to learn. 

Some questions to consider:

* How will you define the universe of objects in your collection?
* How would you like users to interact with those objects?
* What kinds of metadata will you need to allow the types of interactions you want to enable?
* What do you wish you understood better?
* What have you learned today that was or might be especially useful?
