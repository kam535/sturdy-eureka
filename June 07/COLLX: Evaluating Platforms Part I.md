## Before the Session

**Read** "[Ten Factors When Considering Tools](https://handsondataviz.org/tool-factors.html)" from _Data Visualization for All_ by Jack Doughtery and Ilya Ilankyou (2023). Though the authors' particular concerns are data visualization tools, the ten factors listed are a good checklist for other tools as well, such as platforms and content management systems.  

**Review** the following projects from [the list](https://github.com/cornell-colab/2024-SummerDH/blob/main/Workshops/June%2003%3A%20Introduction%20to%20DH/List%20of%20Projects.md) we considered on the first day:  
* Virtual Cartographies
* Idaho Queered
* Seneca Combs Virtual Collection
  
**Can you identify the platform(s) or tool(s) used to build each one?** Does reading the "About" information help? Does reading the credits at the bottom of the page help?
