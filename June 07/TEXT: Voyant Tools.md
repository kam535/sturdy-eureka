## Hour two (TEXT): Voyant Tools

### Before the session
#### 1. Read and watch:
* **Read:** Nguyen, Dong, et al. “[How We Do Things With Words: Analyzing Text as Social and Cultural Data](https://doi.org/10.3389/frai.2020.00062).” Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence, vol. 3, Aug. 2020.
* **Watch** "[Text Analysis: A Walking Tour of What People are Using in Digital Humanities Right Now"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5eAULsBm0w) (Posner, 2021)

#### 2. Bring a text file
Please bring one of the text files you'd like to work with to class in plain text format (i.e., a file with the extension .txt). 

## During the session

### Exploring Voyant
Today, we will spend some time working with [Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org/), a web-based suite of tools that help facilitate text analysis and create visualizations.

We will discuss:
* How to clean up your text file before exploring it in Voyant
* How to create a stopwords list
* Specific tools within Voyant that help us learn about our texts

##### 1. Checking that we each have text files.
If not, take a few minutes to retrieve your files either from online databases or HathiTrust.

##### 2. Begin exploring your texts in Voyant together. Discuss:
* What texts are each of you using?
* Try out a couple visualization tools. Refer to [Voyant's documentation pages](https://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/start) to learn more about the tools.
  * What questions do you have as you explore the visualizations?
  * Are the visualizations effective in helping you learn about the texts?
  * What stopwords might help or hinder your exploration of the texts?
  * Overall, do the tools help you learn anything new or unexpected about your texts?


#### 3. Incorporating stopwords
Notice any words that might not seem relevant to your analysis. Type a list of these words in a plain text file. We will demonstrate how to incorporate these stopwords into the visuallizations.

## After the session

### 1. Reflection
After today's session, please consider:
* What was your experience in learning Voyant? What stood out to you as the tool's strengths? What limitations might you have noticed about it?
* What questions emerged as you examined your text file in Voyant? Did a visualization or particular tool interest you?
* What other text analysis methods are you curious about exploring further?

## Homework this weekend
* Consider the reflection questions posed at the end of Nguyen et. al (2022) this weekend. Are there any questions you'd like to refelect on further?
* (Hopefully calmer!) Python lessons (to be posted by 2pm on Friday!): Stopwords, Regular Expressions,
