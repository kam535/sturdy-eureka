## Before the Session

**Read** Krug, S. (2006). "Chapter 1: Don't Make Me Think" In the book [_Don't Make Me Think!_]( https://catalog.library.cornell.edu/catalog/15141712). (Link goes to the Library's electronic copy of the book. You can also check out one of three paper copies from the Library, or browse the copy in the CoLab.)  

The example graphics look somewhat dated, but the basic prinicples discussed in the book are still very relevant! Read more chapters if you're interested. They are pretty breezy.
