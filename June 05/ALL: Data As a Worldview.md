# ALL: Data As A Worldview. 

## Before the Session  

##### Read  

* Davis, H. (2019). "[A Dataset is a Worldview](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-dataset-is-a-worldview-5328216dd44d)," a blog post on *Towards Data Science*, a *Medium* vertical.  
This short post is about datasets used in machine learning. But the idea that a dataset reflects a worldview is just as relevant to the creation of metadata schema as to corpus creation. 

* Onouha, M. (2016). "[On Missing Datasets](https://github.com/MimiOnuoha/missing-datasets)," documentation of a mixed media art installation.  
And **View** [the photos of the installation on the artist's website](https://mimionuoha.com/the-library-of-missing-datasets).

* D’Ignazio C. and L. Klein (2020). “[The Numbers Don’t Speak for Themselves](https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/4660/chapter/213291/The-Numbers-Don-t-Speak-for-Themselves),” In _Data Feminism_, MIT Press.
