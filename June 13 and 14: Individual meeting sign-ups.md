# Individual meeting sign-ups

During these individual meetings, you will meet with Eliza, Iliana and Matt to check in on how you're thinking about your project and your overall experience in the program so far. This will be helpful as we prepare for mid-program presentations and reflect on feasible goals for the rest of the summer.
