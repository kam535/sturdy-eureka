## Instructions (also sent via email)

For Thursday, we’d like you to offer a reflection on your process this summer: where you started, where your most important twists and turns happened, where you are now, and, if applicable, where you might go in the future. You might think of your presentation as a story about a work in progress
Please think of your final presentation as a story about a work in progress. You are not expected to present a perfectly finished and polished project.

Please plan to talk for 10-15 minutes (with a hard cutoff at 15!). Each person on your panel with present, then we’ll take questions for about 30 minutes. I’ll moderate Q&A for the Collections panel, and Iliana will moderate Q&A for the Text Analysis panel.

Here are some questions that might help you – but don’t feel obligated to address them all:

* What was your plan at the beginning of the summer? What actually happened? Where did you end up? 
* What did you learn? What technical knowledge did you build that was most interesting or valuable to you? What social or theoretical knowledge about digital humanities was most interesting or valuable to you? Did you learn anything about your research subject?
* What was the process of collecting and preparing your data like? What challenges did you encounter? Did you have to perform much data cleaning or manipulation in order to ready your data for use? 
* If you are using a particular tools, software, platforms, or frameworks to build your project, how did you choose it/them? What are their pros and cons? Would you choose it again if you were starting all over? Did you learn anything interesting from the process of evaluating the tool(s) you tried? 
* What was harder than you expected it to be? What was easier than you expected it to be?
* Do you plan to continue to build your practice of digital scholarship in the future? Why or why not?
* Do you see your project or your research goals any differently now than you did at the beginning of the summer?
* Did you have any interesting or productive failures?

## Presentation order and shared slides
Similar to the midterm presentations, we will use a shared computer and slidedecks during the final presentations. Your slides can include links to your website (if it is live!) and screenshots.

**Note:** You can copy and paste your slides from another slide deck file in your Google Drive into your cohort's shared slide deck. In this way, each of you can retain your personal choice in presentation themes. (Let Iliana know if you have questions about this.)
