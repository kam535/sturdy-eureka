## Before the Session  

* **Reflect** on Wednesdays's session. Please respond to the June 4 prompt on the [Discussions](https://github.com/cornell-colab/2024-SummerDH/discussions) page.
  
* **Read** "[Select Your Spreadsheet Tools](https://handsondataviz.org/spreadsheet-tools.html)," from the open-source textbook *Hands-On Data Visualization* by J. Dougherty & I Ilyankou (2024). (Don't leave out the final  sub-section, "Sidebar: Common Data Formats"!)

* Choose a spreadsheet program that meets your needs, and **start writing** metadata for your project. Label your columns, and fill at least five rows with items in your collection, describing the items using the attributes you've designed.

* *Optional if you want to and have time*: Keep working on the map you started in class. Adjust the size and shape of the markers, clean up the tooltips to show whatever you want them to, and add annotations as appropriate. Use [these tutorials](https://academy.datawrapper.de/category/278-symbol-maps) to figure out anything you can't figure out on your own.
