# June 6: "Distant Reading" and Corpus Curation

## Before the Session
1. Complete all pre-work and Python lessons through SDH_Python_2

2. **Readings:** The term "corpus" in text anlaysis refers to a collection of texts. As with close reading contexts, these texts are usually curated according to a shared topic: texts from a particular time period, texts by a particular author, texts of a certain genre, or something else entirely. When you considered exploring a computational text analysis project, you also articulated parameters for the types of text corpus you wanted to build. This process of selecting, organizing, and processing data for analysis is known as "curation."

Today's readings explore the nature of and using text data corpora and performing "distant reading" on them. We'll continue exploring these themes with the full group throughout the summer.

### Readings
During the summer, I'll list our group readings in order of importance. If you are ever short on time, please prioritize the readings listed first.

* Moretti, Franco. “[Conjectures on World Literature](https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii1/articles/franco-moretti-conjectures-on-world-literature).” New Left Review, no. 1, Feb. 2000, pp. 54–68.
* Cottom, Tressie McMillan. “‘[47. More Scale, More Questions: Observations from Sociology](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled/section/55e48b34-543a-41f7-97c9-8c8643bf8844#ch47)’ in ‘Debates in the Digital Humanities 2016’ on Debates in the DH Manifold.” Debates in the Digital Humanities. 2016.

Content notice: Klein briefly mentions sexual harassment at the beginning of this next piece. 
* Klein, Lauren F. ["Distant Reading after Moretti"](https://lklein.com/digital-humanities/distant-reading-after-moretti). 10 Jan. 2018. 

## During the Session

### Hour one: Readings discussion (45 mins)
1. How does Moretti define "distant reading"?
2. How do Cottom's and Klein's respective pieces complicate ideas of categorization and quantification with "distant reading?"
3. How do today's authors discuss the nature of curating text corpora for analysis?
4. What other ideas stick out to you from today's readings?

### Hour two: Reviewing the "Anatomy of a Python Script"

Let's revisit some concepts you've learned through lessons 0, 1 and 2 of Python so far and address any questions. We will use "[Anatomy of a Python Script](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/02-Python/03-Anatomy-Python-Script.html)"
from Walsh (2021).

## After the Session

### 1. Reflection post
Today, we've reflected on the meaning of "distant reading" and ways to incorporate power analyses within text corpus curation. Consider one or both of these questions:
* What points from today's readings and discussions do you want to carry forward into your own text analysis project this summer?
* What challenges, technical or curatorial, do you anticipate in building your corpus? If you already had a strong idea of what would be in your corpus before coming to Summer DH, describe the types of decisions you made to help curate your corpus.

Read and comment on peer reflections from the text group and the collections group as your time allows.

### 2. Prep work for Friday's session
* Review the "before the session" work for Friday's session.
